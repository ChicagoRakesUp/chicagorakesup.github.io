      <h2>How does Chicago compare</h2>
      <p>
        Chicago has been trailing behind in terms of the amount of yard waste that
        has been collected for the past decade, having recycled at its best only 17%
        over the past decade. Whereas other cities’ recycling rates continue to rise
        with every passing year, Chicago is the only city whose rates are constantly
        in decline. Chicago’s line is flat; this is because although
        the other three cities’ collection amounts are in the hundred-thousand tons,
        Chicago’s highest collection of yard waste barely passes 5,500 tons.

      <h2>Our method for removing yard waste</h2>
      <p>The main suggestion that we propose is a system that
        incorporates Chicago’s old system with its new system.
        Mimicking the <strong>Portland Composts!</strong> program, a new yard
        waste bin will be distributed to all of the households
        in Chicago. For the peak yard waste season, which we
        have defined as October through December, a truck
        sponsored by <strong>Republic Services</strong> will be sent out to
        collect all the yard waste on a weekly basis, like the
        garbage trucks do. These  trucks that are used will be
        the same as the ones that will be used on an on-request
        basis. For the rest of the months of the year, the yard
        waste truck will be sent out on an on-request basis,
        much like the current system. </p>
        <h3>Requesting a Yard Waste Pickup</h3>
        <p>
          The method for requesting yard waste pick-up will also be improved.
          The current system instructs residents have to call 311 or fill out
          a tedious online form to have their yard waste picked up.
          Our suggested method aims to simplify this process. Instead having to
          call 311 and wait to be serviced by a representative, residents call our
          number and respond to an automated voice and requires one word commands to
          place a request. In addition, the website form to be filled out is simplified
          as well. When the program first rolls out, residents will register in our
          system and indicate whether they would like only on-demand service of yard
          waste disposal or, in addition to on-demand service, a weekly pickup service
          during the peak yard waste season as well.

    <section id="conclusion">
      <h2>What we are hoping to achieve</h2>
      <p>Through the implementation of the Chicago Rakes Up program,
        we are confident that Chicago will see an increase in the
        amount of yard waste being collected by its residents.
        The program that we are proposing implements the the aspects
        of Chicago’s Blue Cart Recycling Program that works, with some
        additions to increase the overall collection of yard waste greatly.
        In addition, residents can now be sure that they are actually
        recycling their yard waste, since the company that we suggest
        partnering with, company, has been shown in the past to consistently
        and safely discard of yard waste. </p>

        <h3>Chicago Rakes Up</h3>
        <p>The purpose of this proposal is to suggest to the City of Chicago an
          improved method of yard waste removal for the 600,000 residents that
          live there. Parallel to its modern image, Chicago aims to be a sustainable
          and environmentally-friendly city. It cannot easily achieve this goal with
          its current yard waste/composting program, which is utilized by only 1% of
          the city’s residents.</p>
